    <h1>Project overview</h1>
    <p>Our project for EEC 172 was a sketchpad that a user can use to draw using the CC3200 board. They are able to change their colors and tools using a remote, and once they were done with their drawing, they could send the picture to themselves using AWS services.</p>
